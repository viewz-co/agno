"""This cookbook shows how to implement Agentic RAG using Infinity Reranker.

Infinity is a high-performance inference server for text-embeddings, reranking, and classification models.
It provides fast and efficient reranking capabilities for RAG applications.

## Setup Instructions:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run: `pip install agno anthropic infinity-client lancedb`

### 2. Set up Infinity Server
You have several options to deploy Infinity:

#### Local Installation
```bash
# Install infinity
pip install "infinity-emb[all]"

# Run infinity server with reranking model
infinity_emb v2 --model-id BAAI/bge-reranker-base --port 7997
```
Wait for the engine to start.

# For better performance, you can use larger models:
# BAAI/bge-reranker-large
# BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3
# ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2


### 3. Export API Keys
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
```

### 4. Run the Example
```bash
python cookbook/agent_concepts/agentic_search/agentic_rag_infinity_reranker.py
```

## About Infinity Reranker:
- Provides fast, local reranking without external API calls
- Supports multiple state-of-the-art reranking models
- Can be deployed on GPU for better performance
- Offers both sync and async reranking capabilities
- More deployment options: https://michaelfeil.eu/infinity/0.0.76/deploy/
