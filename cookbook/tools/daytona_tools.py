üë©‚Äçüíª Agent with Daytona tools

This example shows how to use Agno's Daytona integration to run Agent-generated code in a remote, secure sandbox.

1. Get your Daytona API key and API URL: https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys
2. Set the API key and API URL as environment variables:
    export DAYTONA_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
    export DAYTONA_API_URL=<your_api_url>
3. Install the dependencies:
    pip install agno anthropic daytona_sdk
