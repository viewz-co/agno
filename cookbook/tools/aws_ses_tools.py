"""
Troubleshooting:
- If emails aren't sending, check:
  * Both sender and recipient are verified (in sandbox mode)
  * AWS credentials are correctly configured
  * You're within sending limits
  * Your IAM user has correct SES permissions
- Use SES Console's 'Send Test Email' feature to verify setup
